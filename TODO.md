# Backend Build and Run Verification TODO

- [x] Step 1: Navigate to backend directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- [ ] Step 2: Run `npm run build` to compile TypeScript; verify no errors and that `dist/index.js` and other files are created.
- [ ] Step 3: Run `node dist/index.js` to start the server; check console for "Server is running on port: 5000".
- [ ] Step 4: Test the /health endpoint to ensure it responds with { status: 'ok' }.
- [ ] Step 5: If errors occur, identify cause and fix (e.g., uncomment routes, adjust imports, move files if needed).
- [ ] Step 6: Report success or issues, including any fixes applied.
